# DAL CONNECT
Dal connect is an application that helps international students integrate into the Dalhousie environment as seamlessly and fast as possible. It is designed to connect new international students together and also provide students with valuable information,Dal connect is an essential application because it helps solve some of the challenges international students face ranging from questions about getting directions to budget planning and questions about classes, courses and general lifestyle in Dalhousie. Features implemented on this include, **buildings location** and **direction**, **new students to-do list**, **student chat** and **budget calculation**.


## Libraries
Provide a list of **ALL** the libraries you used for your project. Example:

**google-gson:** Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. Source [here](https://github.com/google/gson)

## Installation Notes
Installation instructions for markers.

## Code Examples
You will encounter roadblocks and problems while developing your project. Share 2-3 'problems' that your team solved while developing your project. Write a few sentences that describe your solution and provide a code snippet/block that shows your solution. Example:

**Problem 1: We needed a method to calculate a Fibonacci sequence**

A short description.
```
// The method we implemented that solved our problem
public static int fibonacci(int fibIndex) {
    if (memoized.containsKey(fibIndex)) {
        return memoized.get(fibIndex);
    } else {
        int answer = fibonacci(fibIndex - 1) + fibonacci(fibIndex - 2);
        memoized.put(fibIndex, answer);
        return answer;
    }
}

## Feature Section
List all the main features of your application with a brief description of each feature.
- **Building's index**:<br>

- **User Chat**:<br>
This feature enables students to communicate effectively with one another.
- **To-do list**:<br>
This is a list of important tasks that new international students need to do at different time intervals I.e. register for courses,renew study visa or buy a new sim card. 
- **Chatbot**:<br>
The Chat bot will help Students handle simple queries e.g. provide student with information about how to get a sim card as well as other informations.
