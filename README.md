# Project Title
One paragraph to describe your project. Your description should include the project concept and key features implemented.

## Libraries
Provide a list of **ALL** the libraries you used for your project. Example:

**google-gson:** Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. Source [here](https://github.com/google/gson)

## Installation Notes
Installation instructions for markers.

## Code Examples
You will encounter roadblocks and problems while developing your project. Share 2-3 'problems' that your team solved while developing your project. Write a few sentences that describe your solution and provide a code snippet/block that shows your solution. Example:

**Problem 1: We needed a method to calculate a Fibonacci sequence**

A short description.
```
// The method we implemented that solved our problem
public static int fibonacci(int fibIndex) {
    if (memoized.containsKey(fibIndex)) {
        return memoized.get(fibIndex);
    } else {
        int answer = fibonacci(fibIndex - 1) + fibonacci(fibIndex - 2);
        memoized.put(fibIndex, answer);
        return answer;
    }
}
